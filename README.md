Development of a real-world solution to [Rossmann Store Sales challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).

- **Motivation**
	Rossmann is one of the largest drugstore chains in Europe with more than 4.000 stores.
	For some reason, managers of 1115 Rossmann's stores were tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance.

- **Root cause**
	In real situations, it's very important to know what is the root cause of the task because as a Data Scientist, you can think about the problem and, perhaps, present better options. In Kaggle, it's not clear why Rossmann is interested in predicting daily sales, therefore we assume that predicting daily sales is what they need and they want to do that as accurately and automatically as possible.

- **Problem's owner**
	Also interesting to have in real situations, but this information is not available in Kaggle. The problem's owner is the one that knows (or should know) better what is needed. He can be a guide throughout the process.

- **Solution format**
	The solution format should be a three column table with the columns: Store, Date and Daily Sales.
